Route Rakshak
Smarter Roads. Transparent Governance.

Route Rakshak is a civic-tech platform designed to improve road and infrastructure management through citizen participation and data-driven ward performance tracking. It transforms traditional complaint systems into an intelligent governance tool that promotes transparency, accountability, and faster resolution of civic issues.




🚀 Problem Statement

Urban infrastructure complaints often suffer from:

Delayed responses from authorities

Lack of transparency

No ward-level performance tracking

Poor accountability mechanisms

No structured comparison between administrative units

Existing systems allow complaint registration but rarely convert that data into actionable governance insights.




💡 Our Solution

Route Rakshak introduces a smart civic monitoring platform that:

Enables citizens to report infrastructure issues

Tracks complaints systematically

Implements an automated ward ranking system

Encourages performance-driven governance

Promotes transparency through measurable metrics

Instead of being just a complaint portal, Route Rakshak acts as a governance intelligence system.
